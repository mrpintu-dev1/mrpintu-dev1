# Introduction

</div>

Software and technology are my passions. 

Over the last decade I have spent an inordinate amount of time immersed in software challenges, contributing to open source projects and learning technologies.

I get a lot of enjoyment from sharing new ideas and gaining perspective from the experiences of others.

I have an unyieldingly enthusiastic approach to problem solving. I will read documentation (and Stack Overflow), write automated tests and persist with trial and error until the desired result is attained.

Generally I have an entrepreneurial mind, operating personal ventures and attempting start ups. 

I really enjoy greenfield projects where I have the capacity to construct an entire solution from the infrastructure to the team.

My roles have taken me through many disciplines. When working for Zip Co Limited I spent 8 months heavily involved in the development of their security and authentication service.

Whatever the challenge, I enjoy sharing what I learn with colleagues, hosting presentations or writing internal articles.

<p align="center"><i>My personal philosophy is that it’s not a question of if you’re are capable of achieving something, <br>it’s a question of how long it'll take you to learn</i></p>
</br>

<div class="no-print">
I have a strong foundation in front end development with TypeScript is my preferred JavaScript variant.

I have extensive experience with back end services written in Node, and commercial experience with Go (Golang).

I am capable of establishing the development infrastructure necessary to make developing JavaScript based projects complete with the creation of an npm repository, compilers (webpack, rollup, TypeScript), testing libraries.

I have the plethora of experience working with authentication, having implemented an entire OAuth OpenID server and associated clients for Zip Co. 

In terms of infrastructure, I am familiar with the management of Linux servers and managing DNS records though I prefer to delegate those responsibilities to provider with managed services - like AWS.

A common pattern I use to deploy web services is placing a CloudFront distribution in front of an S3 bucket, using Route53 to point a domain to that web service.

If I need a server, I would consider lambda functions and DynamoDB before more involved alternatives.

# Tutorials

I held software development tutorials with the intention of helping aspiring developers enter the industry with relevant skills.

The tutorials started at the absolute basics. Simple control flow such as if statements and for loops. Over time bringing these abstract concepts together to create complete applications, presented using HTML and CSS.

It was an incredible challenge as I had to learn ways to communicate concepts that I was familiar with into the thinking space of intelligent people who had never had exposure to them. 

It challenged a lot of my preconceptions, where I had previously naively assumed a lot of the knowledge in computer science was simple and common, I learned that it can be a challenge to grasp.

Overall, the experience of teaching was massively rewarding and I continued the pursuit through work presentations and online, where I have established a YouTube channel that provides free tutorials.

Every one of my students went on to enter the IT industry. I feel proud to think that in some way, the tutorials we did may have served to contribute to their paths and achievements.

# Articles

I am really passionate about driving positive business outcomes from the pragmatic use of quality software design.  

I will often read books and gain inspiration from the understanding of different paradigms. 

I enjoy sharing my findings by applying them to languages and technologies I use daily by writing articles.

# YouTube

Another medium for knowledge sharing is recorded videos for YouTube. My goal is to provide concepts in a way that's approachable and easy to digest.

# MISC

## Computer Clearance Centre (2013)

I worked for a computer retailer known as Computer Clearance Centre. They specialised in the restoration and sale of bulk purchased ex-government desktops and laptops. My role was primarily sales, but I was involved in the refurbishment and repairs.

I wrote a small software using Microsoft's Visual C# to act as a point of sale. It was terrible, but this was the beginnings of my interest in software engineering.

## On Call Computer Repairs (2012 - 2014)

In my youth I had an entrepreneurial mind. I advertised on-site computer repair services and would drive out to the houses of customers to perform services like malware removal, networking setup, (re)installing Windows.

This was over a large period of time where I used my skills to create additional income on the side of a primary income source.

I made an attempt to gather some written references from that time period, see the links below:
