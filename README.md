# Introduction

</div>

Software and technology are my passions. 

Over the last decade I have spent an inordinate amount of time immersed in software challenges, contributing to open source projects and learning technologies.

I get a lot of enjoyment from sharing new ideas and gaining perspective from the experiences of others.

I have an unyieldingly enthusiastic approach to problem solving. I will read documentation (and Stack Overflow), write automated tests and persist with trial and error until the desired result is attained.

Generally I have an entrepreneurial mind, operating personal ventures and attempting start ups. 

I really enjoy greenfield projects where I have the capacity to construct an entire solution from the infrastructure to the team.

My roles have taken me through many disciplines. When working for Zip Co Limited I spent 8 months heavily involved in the development of their security and authentication service.

Whatever the challenge, I enjoy sharing what I learn with colleagues, hosting presentations or writing internal articles.

<p align="center"><i>My personal philosophy is that it’s not a question of if you’re are capable of achieving something, <br>it’s a question of how long it'll take you to learn</i></p>
</br>

<div class="no-print">
I have a strong foundation in front end development with TypeScript is my preferred JavaScript variant.

I have extensive experience with back end services written in Node, and commercial experience with Go (Golang).

I am capable of establishing the development infrastructure necessary to make developing JavaScript based projects complete with the creation of an npm repository, compilers (webpack, rollup, TypeScript), testing libraries.

I have the plethora of experience working with authentication, having implemented an entire OAuth OpenID server and associated clients for Zip Co. 

In terms of infrastructure, I am familiar with the management of Linux servers and managing DNS records though I prefer to delegate those responsibilities to provider with managed services - like AWS.

A common pattern I use to deploy web services is placing a CloudFront distribution in front of an S3 bucket, using Route53 to point a domain to that web service.

If I need a server, I would consider lambda functions and DynamoDB before more involved alternatives.

# Tutorials

I held software development tutorials with the intention of helping aspiring developers enter the industry with relevant skills.

The tutorials started at the absolute basics. Simple control flow such as if statements and for loops. Over time bringing these abstract concepts together to create complete applications, presented using HTML and CSS.

It was an incredible challenge as I had to learn ways to communicate concepts that I was familiar with into the thinking space of intelligent people who had never had exposure to them. 

It challenged a lot of my preconceptions, where I had previously naively assumed a lot of the knowledge in computer science was simple and common, I learned that it can be a challenge to grasp.

Overall, the experience of teaching was massively rewarding and I continued the pursuit through work presentations and online, where I have established a YouTube channel that provides free tutorials.

Every one of my students went on to enter the IT industry. I feel proud to think that in some way, the tutorials we did may have served to contribute to their paths and achievements.

# Presentations

Sharing knowledge is something which I really enjoy. Hosting presentations on topics I am researching at the time, or on a topic I am working on.

Using the presentations as a forum where other engineers can engage and share their experiences really helps me shape my understanding, as well as share that understanding amongst the group.

## Brown Bag Sessions

In my professional career, I have held brown bag sessions on a multitude of topics. 

These topics range from front end specific concepts like the WC3 custom element specification to back end technology introductions like using Google's Go language.

## Amazon Web Services Tutorials

In an effort to motivate myself and my colleagues to complete our AWS certificate exams, I organised a weekly meeting we called the "AWS Ninjas".

We would go over a new AWS topic each week with the end goal being the successful certification of the staff members.

# Articles

I am really passionate about driving positive business outcomes from the pragmatic use of quality software design.  

I will often read books and gain inspiration from the understanding of different paradigms. 

I enjoy sharing my findings by applying them to languages and technologies I use daily by writing articles.

## SOLID TypeScript

After approaching the Go language, I was introduced to an entire era of software engineering concepts I previously hadn't been exposed to. 

Go is essentially C with a runtime that provides garbage collection and task scheduling. This allows it to introduce novel methods of handling concurrency, high performance and minimal syntax.

One thing that stuck out to me was the community's attitude of not rushing design decision, instead preferring contribution through careful consideration.

The language features minimal keywords, the community leaning on best practices through the use of engineering principles, often personified as proverbs.

Proverbs such as:

```
Accept interfaces, return structs
```

Or 

```
Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating
```

Learning what these proverbs were trying to achieve led me to explore how software could be written in a way in which business would extract the most utility - which involves reusability, testability and deliverability.

All too often I see companies throwing away code, rewriting entire services (particularly in the front end) when little has materially changed.

Reading about SOLID design principles helped me uncover ways in which software could be written to enable business flexibility without compromising the integrity of the software itself.

TypeScript being a superset of JavaScript which grants developers the ability to include type information to standard JavaScript code and given my use of the language, I decided to write an article applying these concepts to it.

# YouTube

Another medium for knowledge sharing is recorded videos for YouTube. My goal is to provide concepts in a way that's approachable and easy to digest.

## Front End Tutorials

In this video I set up an Angular client on an existing http server that is using Go and the web framework Gin. I cover some simple ideas like two way data-binding, structural directives and modules.

# MISC

## Computer Clearance Centre (2013)

I worked for a computer retailer known as Computer Clearance Centre. They specialised in the restoration and sale of bulk purchased ex-government desktops and laptops. My role was primarily sales, but I was involved in the refurbishment and repairs.

I wrote a small software using Microsoft's Visual C# to act as a point of sale. It was terrible, but this was the beginnings of my interest in software engineering.

## On Call Computer Repairs (2012 - 2014)

In my youth I had an entrepreneurial mind. I advertised on-site computer repair services and would drive out to the houses of customers to perform services like malware removal, networking setup, (re)installing Windows.

This was over a large period of time where I used my skills to create additional income on the side of a primary income source.

I made an attempt to gather some written references from that time period, see the links below:

## PSP Homebrew (2007)

At the age of 14, I had a PSP but couldn't afford any games for it. With the desire to play the console but a lack of media to consume, I began searching the internet for free options.

Upon discovering about the concept of homebrew, I started learning how to run it on my PSP.

Eventually I wanted to contribute to the community and write my own homebrew.

Naturally, this introduced me to the world of Linux and C++ which was far to complicated for me at the time. Thankfully there was an alternative Lua runtime which was very easy to get started with.

There was an old video game builder called "Game Maker" which would allow you to build a game using visual tooling.

Inspired by this, and understanding the semantics of Lua, I attempted to reproduce this software using C# and WinForms.

I created the [Windows utility I called "PSP Game Maker"](https://psp.brewology.com/downloads/download.php?id=6510&mcid=1).

I was too young to be capable of creating anything meaningful however this introduction laid the foundation of comfortable familiarity needed to explore the concepts later in life.
